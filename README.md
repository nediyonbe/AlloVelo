# AlloVelo

AlloVelo is a program looking at past data of bike share program of the city of Montreal (called Bixi hereafter) as well as climate data provided by the government of Canada to predict Bixi demand on a given day/hr. 

The main use case considered is Bixi's daily operations. As different bike stations have varying demands at different times, additional bikes are transported by trucks to empty stations. A proactive demand prediction is key to better planning the route of trucks.

Additionally, bixi users can use the result to see what the demand will likely to be in their closest station on an hourly basis. That would give them heads up on what time they should be going to pick up their bike
